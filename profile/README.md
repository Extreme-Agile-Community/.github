# Hi there 👋

Welcome to the Extreme Agile! This documents try to be a comprehensive introduction to agility.

## What is Extreme Agile?

Extreme Agile is a collaborative community space where we all can bring practices that improve delivery of value in the software industry. Its not a one size fits all process so you need to be critical with your use case. We will never offer certifications neither similar processes as we dont believe that is the core of agility.

## Is Extreme Agile for me?

Do you or your team care about continuous improvement? Are you trying to bring value to your users in a Software Project? are you wanting to learn new ways of doing things or even create new ones?
If for any of this questions the answer is yes, this is your community!!!
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
